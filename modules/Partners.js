            <h3>SCAO (Cambodia)</h3>
            <p>SCAO stands for Support Children In Asia Organisation and it is one of the hardest working and fastest growing local NGOs in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It was set up by Mr Samith and his wife, and their goal is to educate as many of Cambodia’s poor.</p>

            <p>Although its volunteers hail from Ireland, Germany and Australia, the organisation is Cambodia run, and always will be.</p>

            <p>Our Founder came across their first school by chance in 2008, and a quick friendship and bond was formed. Andy helped them build more classrooms, and eventually schools, and persuaded Irish teachers and Development Studies graduates to live in Cambodia and work with them. </p>

            <p>SCAO is going from strength to strength, and each school becomes more ambitious, reaching more children and offering more services to their families. </p>

            <p>We are proud to work with them and together have big plans to build more schools in future.</p>

            <p>Get involved!</p>

          <h3>Basic Human Needs (Varanasi, India)</h3>
          <p>Established by a mix of Canadian, German and Irish volunteers, Basic Human Needs is the incredible organisation behind the life changing Jeevan School, working in the poorest part of a city that is situated in the poorest state in India.</p>

          <p>Living and working in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh is not easy for Westerners. Cultural differences, sexist remarks, extreme poverty, stories behind the children that would make you weep, local and severe illnesses – the team at BHN have stood up to all challenges and have also stood the test of time – being in Varanasi now for over 12 years.</p>

          <p>They have seen every scam, saved more lives than we can count, changed 100s of children’s futures, and continue their work there still. Our Jeevan Village project is one of the most adventurous projects to ever happen in Varanasi, and it’s not surprising that the Basic Human Needs team are behind it.</p>

          <p>We are proud to work with them and will work equally hard to make The Jeevan Village a reality. </p>
