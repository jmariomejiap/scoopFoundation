      <p>To date we have helped build 3 schools from scratch, and renovate or improve 4 more, and bought 2 acres of land in India in order to build a new set of homes and classrooms for children of begging families​.</p>

      <p>This may not seem like much, it works at about 1 a year, but we do not receive any government funding and the majority of our funds raised have come from​​ events or online crowdfunding campaigns run by volunteers​.</p>
